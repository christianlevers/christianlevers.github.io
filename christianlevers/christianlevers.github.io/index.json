Farm size is clearly assumed to be linked to environmental, economic, and human wellbeing, and knowledge about farm size distributions can foster the development of actions to address food security and agricultural sustainability. Yet, farm size data (e.g., from censuses or field work) are costly to collect and prone to bias, hampering the availability of consistent data sets covering large areas. Field size data as a proxy for farm size is promising to overcome this limitation, as it facilitates the understanding of field-level farm management and can be mapped more reliably over larger areas via remote sensing techniques. While typically, a one-to-one link is assumed, there is no empirical knowledge about the farm-field size relationship for larger spatial extents.\nWhy do they matter for food security and sustainable agriculture? Assessing the role of farm and field size for achieving food security and sustainable agricultural systems requires sound knowledge on several dimensions. First, we need to know where small and large farms or fields are located and which factors can explain their spatial patterns? Second, assessing the management intensity of farms and fields along size gradients is necessary to estimate productivity and discern management systems. Third, we need to know the socio-environmental trade-offs associated with agricultural production onfarms and fields with varying size to assess issues of agricultural sustainability and identifying potential for smallholder support. Synthesising this knowledge allows assessing archetypical socio-ecological system states and evaluate them with respect to food security and socio-environmental sustainability.\nWhy South America South America is an interesting region to investigate farm and field size patterns. First, it harbours a diverse mix of farm and field sizes, ranging from small livestock farms to large-scale agribusinesses. Second, many regions in South America are active frontiers of agricultural expansion, with some of the highest deforestation rates worldwide, yet also characterised by small-scale and agro-ecological farming that has been adopted within the peasant movement for food sovereignty. Third, the region remains characterised by high levels of economic inequality in spite of improvements over the last two decades.\n","date":1537401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537401600,"objectID":"21aa8ba7f69697d56d98807825abfe7b","permalink":"https://christianlevers.github.io/post/ffsize_blog1/","publishdate":"2018-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ffsize_blog1/","section":"post","summary":"Why is farm and field size important?

Summary\nAgriculture is the dominant land use on Earth, covering approximately one third of its terrestrial surface, and crucial for sustaining human life by providing food, feed, and bioenergy. The importance of agriculture will increase over the next decades as the global demand for agricultural products is expected to rise due to continuing population growth, shifts in consumption, and the increasing role of bioenergy. Agricultural activities incur immense environmental costs such as widespread degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity, high greenhouse gas emissions, and alterations of global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, and also societal costs by increasing social competition and disparities. Consequently, the question of how to meet the growing demand for agricultural products while minimising agriculture\u0026rsquo;s environmental and social impacts is a central challenge.\nEnsuring food security in sustainable ways is of utmost importance to safeguard future human well-being, and targets several of the UN\u0026rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals and Societal Challenges of the EC\u0026rsquo;s Horizon 2020 strategy. Food security involves more than just producing enough food, but includes access (e.g., sufficient income to purchase food), utilisation (i.e., sufficient intake of calories, proteins, and nutrients), and stability (i.e., ability to obtain sufficient food over time). As current global agricultural systems fall short of meeting some of these aspects in many locations, and are arguably not sustainable, several different approaches have been advocated to address these challenges. These range from diversified farming to sustainable intensification to organic farming, but have deficits in addressing all the different components of food security and environmental and social sustainability.\nRecently, smallholder support was defined as a policy priority to address food security, raise the livelihoods of rural communities, and lower environmental costs. Small farms (\u0026lt; 2ha) constitute more than 80% of all farms globally and are mostly in family ownership or operation. Smallholder systems are generally characterised by a high diversity of agricultural and nutritional production, which is often directly accessible by people. Despite these considerable benefits, the majority of these smallholders are themselves prone to food insecurity, poverty, and undernourishment. The ongoing transition in global agriculture toward large-scale farming is making smallholder agriculture increasingly economically unviable, threatening their livelihoods and food security. Supporting small-scale farmers, thus, requires a sound understanding of the operational realities of farms with respect to their size, production, productivity, socio-environmental context, and outcomes.\nObjectives\nThe overall research goal of FFSize is to advance knowledge about size-related characteristics of agriculture in non-Andean South America, in order to inform future land-use decisions and to foster the implementation of targeted policies to support smallholders\u0026rsquo; livelihoods. Specifically, FFSize will link farm and field size patterns to each other, identify their key determinants, quantify their links to land-use intensity as well as socio-economic and environmental outcomes, and to identify potential trade-offs between production and impacts from agriculture.\nCollaborators\n Ralf Seppelt, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, Germany Navin Ramankutty, University of British Columbia, Canada Hannah Wittman, University of British Columbia, Canada Vincent Ricciardi, University of British Columbia, Canada Jordan Graesser, Boston University, USA Verena Seufert, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology - KIT, Germany  ","date":1537081200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537081200,"objectID":"d8f4fbdcd5cfd753cea13f212b02443d","permalink":"https://christianlevers.github.io/project/ffsize/","publishdate":"2018-09-16T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/ffsize/","section":"project","summary":"Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No 796451","tags":["Current projects"],"title":"FFSize (PI)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Contact - Education - Career - Projects - Awards - Professional activities - Memberships\nContact details Dr. Christian Levers\nDepartment of Computational Landscape Ecology | Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ Permoserstr. 15 | 04318 Leipzig | Germany Phone: +49 (0) 341 235 482256\nInstitute for Resources, Environment, and Sustainability | University of British Columbia 2202 Main Mall | Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4 | Canada\nSchool of Public Policy and Global Affairs | University of British Columbia 6476 NW Marine Drive | Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2 | Canada\nWebsite UFZ Website UBC\nEducation  2011 \u0026ndash;
