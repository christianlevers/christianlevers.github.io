      <description>Why farm and field size matters: Exploring their role for food security and sustainable agriculture in South America
This research is funded through the European Union&amp;rsquo;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie grant agreement No 796451.
Summary
Agriculture is the dominant land use on Earth, covering approximately one third of its terrestrial surface, and crucial for sustaining human life by providing food, feed, and bioenergy. The importance of agriculture will increase over the next decades as the global demand for agricultural products is expected to rise due to continuing population growth, shifts in consumption, and the increasing role of bioenergy.</description>
