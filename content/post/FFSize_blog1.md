### Why is farm and field size important?
Farm size is clearly assumed to be linked to environmental, economic, and human wellbeing, and knowledge about farm size distributions can foster the development of actions to address food security and agricultural sustainability. Yet, farm size data (e.g., from censuses or field work) are costly to collect and prone to bias, hampering the availability of consistent data sets covering large areas. Field size data as a proxy for farm size is promising to overcome this limitation, as it facilitates the understanding of field-level farm management and can be mapped more reliably over larger areas via remote sensing techniques. While typically, a one-to-one link is assumed, there is no empirical knowledge about the farm-field size relationship for larger spatial extents.

### Why do they matter for food security and sustainable agriculture?
Assessing the role of farm and field size for achieving food security and sustainable agricultural systems requires sound knowledge on several dimensions. First, we need to know where small and large farms or fields are located and which factors can explain their spatial patterns? Second, assessing the management intensity of farms and fields along size gradients is necessary to estimate productivity and discern management systems. Third, we need to know the socio-environmental trade-offs associated with agricultural production onfarms and fields with varying size to assess issues of agricultural sustainability and identifying potential for smallholder support. Synthesising this knowledge allows assessing archetypical socio-ecological system states and evaluate them with respect to food security and socio-environmental sustainability. 

### Why South America
South America is an interesting region to investigate farm and field size patterns. First, it harbours a diverse mix of farm and field sizes, ranging from small livestock farms to large-scale agribusinesses. Second, many regions in South America are active frontiers of agricultural expansion, with some of the highest deforestation rates worldwide, yet also characterised by small-scale and agro-ecological farming that has been adopted within the peasant movement for food sovereignty. Third, the region remains characterised by high levels of economic inequality in spite of improvements over the last two decades.
