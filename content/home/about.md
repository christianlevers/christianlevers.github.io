# Biography

I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Global Fellow at the Department of Computational Landscape Ecology (Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ) and the Institute for Resources, Environment, and Sustainability (University of British Columbia) as well as a UBC Killam Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs (University of British Columbia).

I was trained as a physical geographer and obtained my Bachelor degree at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum (Germany) in 2006 and my Master degree at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (Germany) in 2009. I graduated as a Dr. rer. nat. (PhD equivalent) in geography at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2016, specialising on large-scale analyses of land-system change. 

In my research, I analyse changes in land-use intensity and assesses spatial patterns of land systems and changes therein, with the aim to better understand how these changes affect the environment and societies. Regionally, my research focus is on Europe and South America.
